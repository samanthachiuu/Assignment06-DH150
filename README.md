**Description**

My project is based on the popular community-based website, Yelp. Yelp is a site where community members can publish reviews for several different kinds of businesses, such as restaurants and salons, for example. The primary usage of Yelp is for its food reviews, so that it is the aspect of Yelp I chose to focus on.

For my project, I chose to emphasize the social aspect of Yelp. I believe that eating is a very social event, and based on my user research, it was made clear to me that most people do not utilize Yelp's social potential. Users primarily use Yelp to find restaurants to eat at, and ultimate decisions seem to be based on some sort of holistic review, considering factors such as rating, pictures, and price. My user research helped me see that Yelp is relatively intuitive to use, but there are some features that are left unused. For example, the potential for the social feed and collections aspects of Yelp are not fully utilized. 

Three personas that I created to further explore this issue could be generalized to encapsulate a large portion of Yelp users. First, Tyler is a young consultant who utilizes Yelp when he is traveling. Tyler wants to indulge in the best local eats for every destination he visits. Next, Justine is a young woman who wants to eat at aesthetically pleasing places for the photos. She relies on Yelp to see photos of the restaurants and food. Lastly, Kelly enjoys being productive, and she uses Yelp to help her find places to study. She wishes Yelp would show live business updates.

After creating these personas to encapsulate a portion of Yelp users, I was able to decide on three features that I think would benefit these personas. The first feature is a "Trending" map feature, which could be used by people when they are traveling in a new place and they want to eat where the locals currently enjoy eating. The second feature is an "Updates" map that compiles and shows all business updates (deals, hour changes, etc.) posted by businesses, which could be used on national days, like National Ice Cream Day, to see current discounts for the day (like BOGO ice cream scoops). The third feature is a "Friends" map that would show friends' activity. This could be used for when people are curious as to where their friends have been eating; this feature would also allow them to go directly from the map to the reviews of the restaurant.

The purpose of this low fidelity prototype is to document the flow of these three features previously described. These wireframes show the potential screens that these features would have, and the wireflows document how the user would navigate through these screens. Low fidelity prototypes are useful to see how the user thinks when presented with a potential solution, and allows people like me to observe how the user thinks and logically map out how the new features will behave.

**Notes**

The process of creating this low-fidelity prototype included starting off with a familiar screen, the Yelp home page. Then, I proceeded to think about the features I wanted to implement. I knew that I wanted to emphasize the social aspect of Yelp, so I created a "Discover" tab that would be present in the header of the website. From there, I created the general "Discover" landing page that incorporated all three of my suggested features. This part was difficult because I was unsure how I wanted to display the "Discover" landing page. Then, I created the individual pages for each map, "Trending," "Updates," and "Friends." I based these maps off of Yelp's existing UI for Collections, which made creating these maps quite easy. I tried to maintain Yelp's UI throughout the creation of this prototype, which helped because it gave me easy design ideas, but it also made it more difficult because I had to envision what style choices Yelp would realistically implement. 

Based on the feedback I received from my prototype testing, there are a few problems I would address in future revisions of my prototype. The two main issues are:
1. There was too much information present on the screen, so it was hard for the user to digest the content and proceed with their intended action. If I were to revise the prototype, I would make sure that the copy I move forward with is as minimalist as possible without obscuring its meaning. For example, the section titled "Where Your Friends are near Los Angeles, CA" is incredibly wordy, and both of my testers left comments that it needed a shorter title and the title itself was not clear what it meant. 
2. Certain click behavior was unclear throughout my prototype. There were several instances where my testers did not know what would happen if they were to click on a certain feature. In a future revision, I would include more screens and wireflows to clearly show what every clickable action leads to. I would also utilize bolding/underlining in a way that users would be able to recognize which aspects of the site are clickable versus which are not.
