**Description** 
My project is based on the popular community-based website, Yelp. Yelp is a site where community members can publish reviews for several different kinds of businesses, such as restaurants and salons, for example. The primary usage of Yelp is for its food reviews, so that it is the aspect of Yelp I chose to focus on.

For my project, I chose to emphasize the social aspect of Yelp. I believe that eating is a very social event, and based on my user research, it was made clear to me that most people do not utilize Yelp's social potential. Users primarily use Yelp to find restaurants to eat at, and ultimate decisions seem to be based on some sort of holistic review, considering factors such as rating, pictures, and price. My user research helped me see that Yelp is relatively intuitive to use, but there are some features that are left unused. For example, the potential for the social feed and collections aspects of Yelp are not fully utilized. 

Three personas that I created to further explore this issue could be generalized to encapsulate a large portion of Yelp users. First, Tyler is a young consultant who utilizes Yelp when he is traveling. Tyler wants to indulge in the best local eats for every destination he visits. Next, Justine is a young woman who wants to eat at aesthetically pleasing places for the photos. She relies on Yelp to see photos of the restaurants and food. Lastly, Kelly enjoys being productive, and she uses Yelp to help her find places to study. She wishes Yelp would show live business updates.

After creating these personas to encapsulate a portion of Yelp users, I was able to decide on three features that I think would benefit these personas. The first feature is a "Trending" map feature, which could be used by people when they are traveling in a new place and they want to eat where the locals currently enjoy eating. The second feature is an "Updates" map that compiles and shows all business updates (deals, hour changes, etc.) posted by businesses, which could be used on national days, like National Ice Cream Day, to see current discounts for the day (like BOGO ice cream scoops). The third feature is a "Friends" map that would show friends' activity. This could be used for when people are curious as to where their friends have been eating; this feature would also allow them to go directly from the map to the reviews of the restaurant.

The purpose of this low fidelity prototype is to document the flow of these three features previously described. These wireframes show the potential screens that these features would have, and the wireflows document how the user would navigate through these screens. Low fidelity prototypes are useful to see how the user thinks when presented with a potential solution, and allows people like me to observe how the user thinks and logically map out how the new features will behave.

**In the Future**
- A description of what you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype.
