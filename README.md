### Sofia Tam
--------------------

To do:
- Create wireframes for at least 5 screens (take pic)
- Sketch and create a wireflow for at least 3 tasks (take pic)
- Have someone use try to prototype and mark places of confusion (take pic)




Please have one page documentation about your low-fidelity prototype:
- A brief description of your project.
- A list of at least 3 tasks that the paper prototype of your system supported.
- A set of at least 3 pictures of the prototype in different states, showing it being tested.
- A description of what you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype.



+1: Brief summary of user-research, persona and three+ features you wrote as usage scenario; The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping

+1: Complete interaction sequences for all the possible choices and exit/cancel/back were clearly presented via wireflow

+1: Summary of the process, what went smoothly or differently from your expectation

+1: What you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype.

Tip(1): if you have multiple revisions + test history reported, it is a good reason for the instructor to give you extra creditsx
